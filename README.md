## Prometheus with 5xx and 4xx

Monitoring HTTP error metrics is a crucial aspect of understanding and improving the stability and user experience of your web application. By tracking the frequency and types of HTTP errors, you can gain insights into potential issues in your application or its infrastructure.

**Spring Boot, Micrometer, and Prometheus Integration**

Spring Boot 2.x integrates smoothly with Micrometer, a dimensional application metrics facade. Micrometer provides a set of out-of-the-box instrumentations for JVM-based applications and, when integrated with Spring Boot, automatically captures a wide range of metrics, including HTTP request metrics.

### 1. Basic HTTP Request Metrics

Once Micrometer is integrated (as you've already done with the `micrometer-registry-prometheus` dependency), Spring Boot automatically exposes the `http.server.requests` metric. This metric provides details about incoming HTTP requests, tagged (or labeled) by attributes such as:

- `status`: The HTTP response status code (e.g., `200`, `404`, `500`).
- `exception`: The exception class name, if an exception was thrown during request processing.
- `method`: The HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
- `uri`: The request URI pattern (not the exact path to avoid high cardinality).

### 2. Monitoring 4XX and 5XX Status Codes

Using the `http.server.requests` metric, you can filter or aggregate by the `status` label to monitor 4XX and 5XX status codes specifically.

For instance, in Prometheus Query Language (PromQL), you might use queries like:

- **Count of 5XX errors in the last 5 minutes:**  
  `sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{status=~"5.."}[5m]))`

- **Count of 4XX errors in the last 5 minutes:**  
  `sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{status=~"4.."}[5m]))`

### 3. Alerts

Once you've got the metrics and can query them, a natural next step is to set up alerts for abnormal patterns. For example:

- Alert if the rate of 5XX errors exceeds a certain threshold.
- Alert if a specific endpoint starts returning an elevated rate of 4XX errors.

These alerts can be set up within Prometheus itself or in a tool like Grafana, which can query Prometheus and has a more sophisticated alerting mechanism.

### 4. Visualizing the Metrics

Visualization is crucial for interpreting the metrics data effectively. Using tools like Grafana, you can create dashboards to visualize the rate of 4XX and 5XX errors over time, the most common error endpoints, error rates compared to overall traffic rates, etc. Such dashboards provide a quick overview of the application's health and can help in diagnosing issues.

### 5. Digging Deeper

Beyond just the count or rate of errors, you might want to track other associated metrics:

- **Latency of error responses:** If certain errors also correspond with high latency, it might indicate resource contention or other backend issues.
  
- **Correlation with other metrics:** Perhaps the rate of errors increases when the JVM garbage collection pauses are high, or when a certain upstream service is down.

By correlating error metrics with other system or application metrics, you can gain deeper insights into the root causes of issues.

### Conclusion

Monitoring HTTP error metrics, especially 4XX and 5XX status codes, gives you a direct view into the problems your users might be facing. Combined with other monitoring tools and practices, it forms a robust framework for ensuring the reliability and performance of your web application.


# Logging Strategies

Absolutely, adding structured logging with specific keywords or fields makes it easier to parse, search, and set up alerts on logs, especially in platforms like Sumo Logic, ELK, Splunk, etc.

Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Structured Logging**:
   - Instead of plain text logs, consider logging in a structured format, like JSON. This way, each piece of information will be a field in the JSON object. This makes it easier to parse and search for specific fields.
   - Libraries like `Logstash Logback Encoder` can help log in JSON format with Spring Boot.

2. **Defining Keywords or Fields**:
   - For every type of error or event, define specific fields or keywords.
     - **Form Errors**: `{ "eventType": "FORM_ERROR", "field": "username", "error": "REQUIRED" }`
     - **Timeout**: `{ "eventType": "TIMEOUT", "service": "inventoryService", "duration": "5100ms" }`
     - **Authentication**: `{ "eventType": "AUTH_FAILURE", "reason": "EXPIRED_PASSWORD" }`
     - **HTTP Errors**: `{ "eventType": "HTTP_ERROR", "statusCode": "500", "reason": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR" }`
     
3. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - For exceptions, apart from the stack trace, capture and log important contextual data, such as the input that caused it, the user, the service name, etc.
   - This context can be crucial when debugging.

4. **Using MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)**:
   - MDC is a powerful feature provided by logging frameworks, allowing you to set specific fields for a thread that are automatically added to every log statement executed by that thread.
   - Useful for logging contextual information, like user ID, session ID, etc. This way, you can trace all logs of a specific user/session.

5. **In Sumo Logic (or your monitoring tool)**:
   - Set up searches or queries based on these structured fields.
   - Create alerts or dashboards based on these specific error keywords or patterns.
   - E.g., an alert could be set up if there's an increase in `AUTH_FAILURE` events due to `EXPIRED_PASSWORD`.

6. **Regularly Review and Refine**:
   - As your application evolves, the errors it might encounter could change. Regularly review the logs to ensure you're capturing the necessary fields and keywords.

**Steps to Implement**:
1. Integrate a structured logging library.
2. Update your logging statements to use the structured format and add the defined keywords or fields.
3. Test to ensure logs are captured correctly.
4. In your monitoring tool, set up parsing rules, searches, alerts, or dashboards based on these fields or keywords.

When presenting to your boss, emphasize how this structured and keyword-based logging will:
- Improve troubleshooting speed.
- Provide clear visibility into specific errors.
- Allow setting up proactive monitoring and alerts.
- Make the logs more readable and understandable.

Always ensure that no sensitive information is being logged, and regularly audit logs to maintain privacy and compliance.


Prometheus is primarily a monitoring system and time-series database designed for reliability and scalability. It's excellent for monitoring metrics and alerting based on those metrics, but it's not designed to be a log management or parsing system.

Here's what Prometheus excels at:

1. **Scraping Metrics**: Prometheus pulls metrics from your applications or services at regular intervals.

2. **Storing Metrics**: It stores these metrics as time-series data, allowing you to analyze historical data.

3. **Alerting**: Based on the metrics and predefined rules, Prometheus can trigger alerts.

4. **Querying**: Prometheus has its own query language called PromQL, which allows for efficient querying and aggregation of time-series data.

However, if you're looking to parse logs, extract specific fields, or search logs based on specific patterns or keywords, Prometheus isn't the tool for that. That's where log management tools like Sumo Logic, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Loki, etc., come in.


In conclusion:
- For structured logging, parsing logs, and keyword-based searches: Use tools like Sumo Logic, ELK, Splunk, or Loki.
- For monitoring application metrics and alerting based on metric thresholds: Use Prometheus.


# Sumologic and Prometheus

Sumo Logic can collect Prometheus metrics from Kubernetes by integrating with the Prometheus collector within Sumo Logic's Kubernetes Collection solution. This is done using Sumo Logic's Fluentd-based collector to scrape Prometheus metrics from pods or services annotated appropriately.

Hereâ€™s how it generally works:

1. **Prometheus Annotations**:
   - You annotate your pods or services with specific Prometheus annotations. These annotations indicate that a pod or service wants its metrics to be scraped.
   - Common annotations include:
     - `prometheus.io/scrape`: Set to 'true' to enable scraping for this pod or service.
     - `prometheus.io/path`: If the metrics path is not '/metrics', define it with this annotation.
     - `prometheus.io/port`: Define the port to scrape metrics from.
   
2. **Deploy Sumo Logic's Kubernetes Collection Solution**:
   - You deploy the Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection solution, which includes a Fluentd-based collector that has the capability to scrape Prometheus metrics based on the aforementioned annotations.
   - This Fluentd collector will be configured to recognize and scrape from the Prometheus-annotated pods or services.
   
3. **Metric Collection**:
   - Fluentd checks for the presence of the Prometheus annotations in the Kubernetes metadata.
   - If it finds a pod or service with the scrape annotation set to true, it will scrape metrics from the specified path and port.
   
4. **Forward to Sumo Logic**:
   - Once the metrics are scraped, the Fluentd collector sends them to Sumo Logic for storage, analysis, visualization, and alerting.

5. **Visualization and Alerts**:
   - Within Sumo Logic, you can create dashboards to visualize the Prometheus metrics, set up queries to analyze trends, and establish alerts based on thresholds or anomalies.

**Steps to Set It Up**:

1. Annotate your Kubernetes pods or services that expose Prometheus metrics with the appropriate annotations.
   
2. Deploy and set up Sumo Logic's Kubernetes collection solution. Ensure you configure it to include the Prometheus metrics scraping feature.
   
3. Once deployed, verify metrics are being scraped by checking in Sumo Logic's interface to ensure the data is coming in.

4. Create dashboards, alerts, or queries in Sumo Logic based on the Prometheus metrics.

It's also worth noting that Sumo Logic might iterate and refine their integrations over time. So, always refer to the official Sumo Logic documentation or guides for the most up-to-date and detailed instructions.



Absolutely! Let's delve deeper into Structured Logging and Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC).

## Structured Logging:

Structured logging is a method where log messages are written out in a predictable structure. This often means using a format like JSON to organize the data, making it far easier to analyze.

**Benefits:**
- Easier to parse and analyze, especially with tools like ELK Stack, Splunk, and Sumo Logic.
- Provides better context as you can include more data fields in a structured manner.
- Consistency across all log messages.

**Sample Code for Structured Logging with Spring Boot:**

1. Add the required dependencies:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.logstash.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logstash-logback-encoder</artifactId>
    <version>YOUR_VERSION_HERE</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Update your `logback-spring.xml` to utilize the JSON encoder:

```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="JSON" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
    </appender>
    <root level="info">
        <appender-ref ref="JSON" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

3. Log messages:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class SampleService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleService.class);

    public void someMethod() {
        logger.info("User created successfully with id {}", userId);
    }
}
```

This would produce a log like:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00.000+00:00",
    "level": "INFO",
    "thread": "main",
    "logger": "com.example.SampleService",
    "message": "User created successfully with id 123",
    ...
}
```

## Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC):

MDC allows you to add contextual data to logs. For instance, in a web application, you might want to log the username or user ID with every log message. Instead of adding this to every log statement, you set it once at the beginning of the request and then automatically include it in every log message.

**Benefits:**
- Provides richer context for log messages.
- Reduces repetition by avoiding the need to log the same contextual data repeatedly.
- Helps in tracing the flow of transactions or requests.

**Sample Code for MDC with Spring Boot:**

1. Set values in MDC at the start of a request (this might be in a filter or interceptor):

```java
import org.slf4j.MDC;

public class RequestContextInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) {
        MDC.put("userId", request.getHeader("UserId"));
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex) {
        MDC.clear();
    }
}
```

2. In your services or controllers, simply log as usual:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class SampleService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleService.class);

    public void someMethod() {
        logger.info("Fetching data for the user");
    }
}
```

The log will now include the `userId` automatically:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00.000+00:00",
    "level": "INFO",
    "thread": "main",
    "logger": "com.example.SampleService",
    "message": "Fetching data for the user",
    "userId": "123"
    ...
}
```
By combining structured logging and MDC, you make your logs both standardized and context-rich, which is invaluable for troubleshooting and analysis.


Capturing HTTP error codes (4XX and 5XX) is essential for tracking and monitoring the health of your web applications. Spring Boot, with the help of Spring Web, provides mechanisms to handle exceptions and translate them into meaningful HTTP responses.

Here's how you can capture and log 4XX and 5XX errors in your Spring Boot application:

## 1. Global Exception Handling with `@ControllerAdvice`

You can use `@ControllerAdvice` to define a global exception handler that captures exceptions from all controllers in your application:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.server.ResponseStatusException;

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class);

    @ExceptionHandler(ResponseStatusException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleResponseStatusException(ResponseStatusException ex) {
        logger.error("HTTP Error: {}", ex.getStatus(), ex);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(ex.getReason(), ex.getStatus());
    }
    
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleAllOtherExceptions(Exception ex) {
        logger.error("Unexpected error occurred: ", ex);
        return new ResponseEntity<>("An unexpected error occurred", HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

With this setup, any thrown `ResponseStatusException` will be caught by `handleResponseStatusException`, while other exceptions will fall to `handleAllOtherExceptions`. You can extend this to handle other specific exceptions as needed.

## 2. Custom Error Attributes with `ErrorController`

Spring Boot provides a default `/error` mapping through its `BasicErrorController` which acts as a catch-all for any error that bubbles up. You can extend this behavior by providing your custom error attributes or a custom `ErrorController`.

Here's a basic example:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.error.DefaultErrorAttributes;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest;

import java.util.Map;

@Component
public class CustomErrorAttributes extends DefaultErrorAttributes {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomErrorAttributes.class);

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getErrorAttributes(WebRequest webRequest, boolean includeStackTrace) {
        Map<String, Object> errorAttributes = super.getErrorAttributes(webRequest, includeStackTrace);
        Throwable error = getError(webRequest);

        if (error instanceof ResponseStatusException) {
            logger.error("HTTP Error: {}", ((ResponseStatusException) error).getStatus(), error);
        } else {
            logger.error("Unexpected error occurred: ", error);
        }

        return errorAttributes;
    }
}
```

This will augment the default `/error` handling to include additional logging for both 4XX and 5XX errors.

## 3. Monitor HTTP Error Metrics

If you've integrated with `micrometer` and Prometheus (as your previous configurations suggest), you can also monitor the number of 4XX and 5XX responses using metrics. Spring Boot automatically provides metrics for HTTP requests under the `http.server.requests` metric name. This metric includes labels/tags for the HTTP status code, so you can easily track the number of 4XX and 5XX responses over time.

With these mechanisms in place, you'll have a robust system to capture, log, and monitor 4XX and 5XX errors in your Spring Boot application.
