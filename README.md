Absolutely, adding structured logging with specific keywords or fields makes it easier to parse, search, and set up alerts on logs, especially in platforms like Sumo Logic, ELK, Splunk, etc.

Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Structured Logging**:
   - Instead of plain text logs, consider logging in a structured format, like JSON. This way, each piece of information will be a field in the JSON object. This makes it easier to parse and search for specific fields.
   - Libraries like `Logstash Logback Encoder` can help log in JSON format with Spring Boot.

2. **Defining Keywords or Fields**:
   - For every type of error or event, define specific fields or keywords.
     - **Form Errors**: `{ "eventType": "FORM_ERROR", "field": "username", "error": "REQUIRED" }`
     - **Timeout**: `{ "eventType": "TIMEOUT", "service": "inventoryService", "duration": "5100ms" }`
     - **Authentication**: `{ "eventType": "AUTH_FAILURE", "reason": "EXPIRED_PASSWORD" }`
     - **HTTP Errors**: `{ "eventType": "HTTP_ERROR", "statusCode": "500", "reason": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR" }`
     
3. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - For exceptions, apart from the stack trace, capture and log important contextual data, such as the input that caused it, the user, the service name, etc.
   - This context can be crucial when debugging.

4. **Using MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)**:
   - MDC is a powerful feature provided by logging frameworks, allowing you to set specific fields for a thread that are automatically added to every log statement executed by that thread.
   - Useful for logging contextual information, like user ID, session ID, etc. This way, you can trace all logs of a specific user/session.

5. **In Sumo Logic (or your monitoring tool)**:
   - Set up searches or queries based on these structured fields.
   - Create alerts or dashboards based on these specific error keywords or patterns.
   - E.g., an alert could be set up if there's an increase in `AUTH_FAILURE` events due to `EXPIRED_PASSWORD`.

6. **Regularly Review and Refine**:
   - As your application evolves, the errors it might encounter could change. Regularly review the logs to ensure you're capturing the necessary fields and keywords.

**Steps to Implement**:
1. Integrate a structured logging library.
2. Update your logging statements to use the structured format and add the defined keywords or fields.
3. Test to ensure logs are captured correctly.
4. In your monitoring tool, set up parsing rules, searches, alerts, or dashboards based on these fields or keywords.

When presenting to your boss, emphasize how this structured and keyword-based logging will:
- Improve troubleshooting speed.
- Provide clear visibility into specific errors.
- Allow setting up proactive monitoring and alerts.
- Make the logs more readable and understandable.

Always ensure that no sensitive information is being logged, and regularly audit logs to maintain privacy and compliance.
